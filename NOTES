TODO
----
* Create a CGI providing an admin interface, leveraging the socket control
	mechanism
* Clean up documentation
* Extend alias and Resolver.encode_answer() to support custom TTL
* Fix shutdown to properly terminate threads
* Implement rmalias, rmlisten
* Implement dump to export current state in format that could later be loaded
* Investigate alternative backends for alias mapping, including memcache & repcache, sqlite, etc.

DEVELOPMENT
-----------
* New commands are created simply by adding methods to CNamedCommander
	class.
* Can number of classes be reduced?
* Data currently written to Resolver as text, and read as encoded
	message.  Need to be able to read as text, for "dump" or logging.
